# First task (Mario saving the princess)
#  Mario and the princess are trapped in a square grid (N*N), Mario needs to reach the princess with minimum number of steps (shortest paths),
#  while avoiding any obstacles. Mario can move UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT and canâ€™t go outside of the grid. Create a function or a class that
#  given a square grid (N*N), the location of Mario and the princess will return a list of the shortest paths possible from Mario to the princess.
#     Mario denoted by (m)
#     Princess denoted by (p)
#     Obstacle denoted by (x)
#     Free cell denoted by (-)
